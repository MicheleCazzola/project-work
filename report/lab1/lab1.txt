Vanilla single-mutation Hill Climbing is correctly implemented, but it has its known limitations due to lack of exploration.

Simulated annealing is good too, maybe the only improvement could be using a linear relationship between temperature and probabilty
of accepting a worsening solution, instead of an exponential one. This strategy seems to have a great potential if run for more
iterations, as you can see in your final plot.

The variant with iterated local search may perform better if the restart point would be a global one, instead of the current best
solution: in this way, the algorithm would be more oriented on exploration and it may escape some local maximum. Note that its plot
is very similar to the first strategy one, thus they are maybe stuck in the same local maximum. Moreover, doing more repetitions
(restarts) could lead to better results, even if time complexity is a though problem here.

The self-adaptive variant gets similar results as simulated annealing with exponential adaptive temperature (second strategy). Here,
you can try multiplicating strenght instead of summing a fixed quantity, in order to have a variation proportional to the previous
value. By the way, these two algorithms have a similar structure and principles (alternate exploration and exploitation in some way),
but the second one may be better after many iterations: unfortunately, the only way to know is to run it more!

Your solution is not related to set cover, but to knapsack problem.
Anyway, it is a good and quite effective solution, which could be further improved by using simulated annealing with possibly a
self-adaptive strategy.
